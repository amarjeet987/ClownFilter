# ClownFilter
Filter that adds a clown nose to your face using Keras and OpenCV.

## Description :

**1)** ```file1.ipynb``` contains the basic setup of the model, as well as for training the model.<br>

**2)** You can download the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection">here.</a> I suggest reading the description of the dataset as well.<br>
  
**3)** Here, I have used the predefined ```haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml``` for detecting faces in the video. More of them can be found <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades">here.</a>

**4)** ```video_feed.ipynb``` contains the part where we apply the model to make us look like clowns ( xD ). I mean the file containing the openCV implementation to detect the facial keypoints in realtime.

### Long live AI, Happy Coding.
